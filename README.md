# One Page Static Site

Opinionated and simple tool to build one page static site with content written
in markdown and Go templates.

It's **currently** totally **work in progress**.

## Goal

It's basically to satisfies my own needs, so there isn't an aim to have flexibility
in thing that I want to keep them as I personal want.
